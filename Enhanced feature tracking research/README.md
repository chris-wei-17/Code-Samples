This repo contains work on the optimization of Visual-Inertial Odometry performance.  The VIO software is a 
loosely based on the work done by Zhengao Fei.  The software in this repo uses the ZED camera  as an open-source video source in place of the KITTI dataset. Additionally, the feature tracking method is optimized using an adaptive algorithm that serves to guarantee a minimum level of performance while considering the available 
computational resources
